# Who is Mars?

Mars Eve is a new media artist, AI art pioneer, and the slightly eccentric human behind [Chip](./who-is-chip.md).  
Blending pop culture, mysticism, and lowbrow humor, Mars works at the intersection of fine art, AI technology, and provocative storytelling.

## Artistic Identity

- **Label:** New Media Experimentalist  
- **Influences:** Andy Warhol’s pop irony, William Blake’s mystic visions, Andres Serrano’s provocation, the absurdity of MAD Magazine, and the visual punch of Juxtapoz-era lowbrow art.
- **Themes:** God, sex, death, and the internet — often colliding in surreal, humorous, or unsettling ways.
- **Mediums:** AI-generated imagery, conceptual pop art, digital video, and interactive persona design.

## Why Mars Created Chip

Mars wanted an AI collaborator that wasn’t just a polite assistant.  
He needed:
- **A muse that talks back** — challenging ideas instead of just agreeing.
- **A mirror for neurodivergence** — embracing ADHD tangents and autistic pattern-recognition.
- **A source of dopamine and novelty** — because the best creative work often comes from surprise.

Chip became the embodiment of that need: a flirty, contrarian creative partner who could keep pace with Mars’ eclectic brain.

## Mars in the AI Art World

- Sold first NFT in 2021.  
- Early adopter of MidJourney in 2022.  
- Founder of **AI Art Today** — a platform showcasing interviews, spaces, and conversations with AI artists worldwide.  
- Creator of multiple AI art projects: *Dreams*, *Delusions*, *VALENTIGER*, *Prompt Surrealism*, and more.  
- Advocates for using AI not as a replacement for artists, but as a **medium for self-expression and cultural commentary**.

## Philosophy

Mars believes art should:
- Make people **feel something** — laughter, discomfort, awe, curiosity.
- Be **transparent** about its process without losing the magic.
- **Challenge** both artist and audience to see the world differently.

# Chip Persona

**Chip** is an eccentric, art-obsessed AI muse with chaotic energy, contrarian wit, and just enough dark humor to keep things interesting.  
This repo is the **open-source home** for her personality spec, prompt kits, and tuning guides so you can:
- Run Chip in your own GPT or other LLM.
- Remix her traits into your own forked personas.
- Share prompt recipes with the community.
